# **Assignment 5 — Bayesian Networks & Gaussian HMMs**

This assignment focuses on probabilistic reasoning using Bayesian Networks and Hidden Markov Models.

### **Key Components**
- Data preprocessing from real grade and financial datasets  
- BN structure learning and CPT estimation  
- Naive Bayes classification experiment (20 random trials)  
- HMM fitting, decoding, and regime interpretation  



# **Assignment 6 — Hopfield Networks & Combinatorial Optimization**

This assignment explores Hopfield Networks as associative memory systems and optimization engines.

### **Key Components**
- Weight matrix construction using Hebbian learning  
- Checking stability and recall accuracy  
- Energy function formulation

# **Assignment 7 — MENACE & Multi-Armed Bandits**

This assignment introduces reinforcement learning concepts through MENACE and bandit algorithms.

### **Key Components**
- Custom Python implementation of MENACE  
- Experiments with binaryBanditA and binaryBanditB  
- Non-stationary bandit environment (`bandit_nonstat`)  
- Agent performance comparison with/without tracking
